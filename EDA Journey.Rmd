MIILESTONE2.A
EDA journey
First we analyse the First Dataset, % of Elctricity per country per year.
-Which Data set columns can be clean in order to do a more concise analysis?
-

```{r}
summary(dfA)
```

With a brief summary we notice the following:
-There is no data for the years: 1960-1981 and 2021
-First Register is 1990 with 158 missing values
-Last register in 2020 has only 2-3 missing values , we see this since 2009

We also can get the folowing insights:

We Clean the Data in order to eliminate redundant columns:
```{r}

dfa1 <- select(dfA,-('1960':'1989'),-'2021',-'Indicator Name',-'Indicator Code')
```
First thing to analyse is to compare the data of 1990 (Our starting point) and 2020 (ending point)
Whcih arte de diferences in general descriptions of 1990 and 2020?
Wich is the country with less % of population with elcitrycity in 1990?
Wich is the country with less % of population with elcitrycity in 2020?
```{r}
summary(dfa1[c('1990','2020')])
min2020 <- which.min(dfa1$'2020')
CNM2020 <- dfa1$'Country Name'[min2020]
min1990 <- which.min(dfa1$'1990')
CNM1990 <- dfa1$'Country Name'[min1990]
#Wich was the least covered country in 1990?
CNM1990
#Wich was the least covered country in 2020?
CNM2020
```
South Sudan number are quite low, want to do deep dive in order to understand it´s value:
```{r}
dfa1 %>% filter(dfa1$'Country Name' == 'South Sudan')
```
We can see South Sudan has data since 2006 were it started with 0,6%, and they been improving slowly. The value is surpisingly low, but it´s consistent trough the years and it´s improving.

We also want to Deep dive in Zambia, have they improved?

```{r}
dfa1 %>% filter(dfa1$'Country Name' == 'Zambia')
```
We see Zambia have improved from 13.90% in 1990 to 44.5% in 2020. Despite the 2020 number is low, they have improved over the years.

We are from Chile and Colombia, we are interested to see our nation values:
```{r}
dfa1 %>% filter(dfa1$`Country Name` %in% c("Chile","Colombia"))
```
We see a positive evoluton with a 100% coverage in 2020.

How many countries in 2022 are below the global average of 2022 (86.412%)? 
Wich % of the total countries?
```{r}

avg2020 <- mean(dfa1$`2020`,na.rm = TRUE)
dfa1 <- dfa1 %>%
mutate(
global_average=
  ifelse(
    dfa1$`2020` < avg2020
    ,1,0))
sum(dfa1$`global_average`,na.rm=TRUE)
sum(dfa1$`global_average`,na.rm=TRUE)/length(dfa1$`global_average`)

```

From those nationsbelow the global average(2020), what is the average accesses of electricity coverage?
```{r}

dfa1_below <- dfa1 %>% filter(dfa1$`global_average`== 1)
mean(dfa1_below$`2020`,na.rm = TRUE)
```
Wich are the top 10 nations with lowest % of electriciy coverage in 2020?
What is the diference respect 2020?
```{r}

dfa1 <-dfa1 %>% 
  mutate(
    difference_between_2020_2000 = dfa1$"2020" - dfa1$"2000"
  )
dfbottom = dfa1[order(dfa1$"2020", decreasing = FALSE), ] %>% 
  select("Country Name", "2020","difference_between_2020_2000")
dfbottom %>% head(10)
```
Are there any nations wich had decrease it % of coverage between 2020-200? 
Which are they?
```{r}

dfa1 <-dfa1 %>% 
  mutate(
    difference_between_2020_2000 = dfa1$"2020" - dfa1$"2000"
  )
dfa1 %>% 
  arrange(difference_between_2020_2000) %>% 
  select(`Country Name`, difference_between_2020_2000) %>% 
  head(3)

```
How many countries are over 95% of coverage? 
Wich %  the total nations do they represent?
```{r}
dftop <- dfa1 %>%
  filter(`2020` > 95) %>% 
  nrow()
print(dftop)
sum(dftop)/length(dfa1$"2020")
```
It´s impressive to see 65% of the nations are over 95%.

##MILESTONE2-B:
In order to build interestenig table, We want to understand the second database in our database:
```{r}
summary(dfB)
unique(dfB$Region)
unique(dfB$IncomeGroup)
```
We see we have 8 Unique region and 4 income level.
We want to understand the data by Region and Income Level so we joint de dataframes,
```{r}
#We will leftjoin the dataset in order to ubnderstand the data by nation at a region and income level
dfull <- dfa1 %>% 
  left_join(dfB, 
            by = 'Country Code') 
```
For the first table we want to se a summary of the general information by Region.

```{r}
library("kableExtra")
library("knitr")
RegionGroup <- dfull %>% 
group_by(Region) %>% 
  summarise(
    Total_Nations = length(`2020`),
    Mean_2020 = mean(`2020`,na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_2010 = mean(`2010`,na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_2000 = mean(`2000`,na.rm = TRUE),
    Below_Global_AVG = mean(`global_average`,na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  arrange(desc(Mean_2020),.by_group = FALSE)%>%
  filter(Region != "")
kable(RegionGroup,caption= "<ul>
                  Summary Statistics by Region:
                  <li>In 2020 they only region below 90% is Sub-Saharan Africa</li>
                  <li>All regions have improved trhough the years</li>
                  <li>Almost 90% of Sub-Saharan Africa are below global avg</li>") %>%
  kable_styling()
```

For the second table we want to se a summary of the general information by Income level.
```{r}
IncomeGroup <- dfull %>% 
group_by(IncomeGroup) %>% 
  summarise(
    Total_Nations = length(`2020`),
    Mean_2020 = mean(`2020`,na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_2010 = mean(`2010`,na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_2000 = mean(`2000`,na.rm = TRUE),
    Below_Global_AVG = mean(`global_average`,na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  arrange(desc(Mean_2020),.by_group = FALSE)%>%
  filter(IncomeGroup != "")
kable(IncomeGroup,caption= "<ul>
                  Summary Statistics by Income Group:
                  <li>In 2020 they Lower income levels are below 85%</li>
                  <li>All regions have improved trhough the years</li>
                  <li>More than 90% of Low Income level are below global avg</li>") %>%
  kable_styling()
```
We want to do a third table in order tO understand the situation of Sub-Saharan Africa per Income level
```{r}
RegionGroupIncome <- dfull %>% 
group_by(Region,IncomeGroup) %>% 
  summarise(
    Total_Nations = length(`2020`),
    Mean_2020 = mean(`2020`,na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_2010 = mean(`2010`,na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_2000 = mean(`2000`,na.rm = TRUE),
    Below_Global_AVG = mean(`global_average`,na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  arrange(desc(Mean_2020),.by_group = FALSE)%>%
  filter(
    (Region != "") & 
    (IncomeGroup != "") &
    (Region == "Sub-Saharan Africa")
    )
kable(RegionGroupIncome,caption= "<ul>
                  Summary Statistics by Income Group in Sub-Saharan Africa :
                  <li>Critical Situation for Lowe Income</li>
                  <li>100% of lowest income are below Global Average</li>
                  ") %>%
  kable_styling()
```
